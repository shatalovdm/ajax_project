# Ajax project

This simple one page [website](http://dshatalov.com/ajax_project/) is created to practice working with different APIs. For this project I used New York Times, Google Maps, and Wikipedia APIs and jQuery to talk to them.

## Getting Started

Type in any street and city and click submit. The background picture from Google Maps, New York Times news feed and Wikipedia articles in accordance with the specified location will appear on the screen.
